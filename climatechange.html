    <h2 class="centered">Climate Change</h2>
    <p>To put it simply, climate change is the difference in the Earth's global climate over time.  It can result in temperature in certain places either getting warmer or cooler.  Climate change is usually used in the same context of global warming, although the latter mostly refers to climates getting warmer.  Climate change negatively affects our world with one example being that it leads to worse and more extreme natural disasters.  Climate change also impacts Antartica as it has started to break up.  Once ice has broken off of its glacier it can go into the ocean increasing the water's volume which may cause the coast to slowly disappear bit by bit, affecting coastal communities. </p>
