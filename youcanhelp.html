    <h2>The earth is facing a very steep downhill and its not too late to stop it. Itâ€™s slowly dying by the day because of climate change, fossil fuels, plastic in the ocean and more. Here are some ways you could do your part to help the environment:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use reusable bags</li>
      <p>By using reusable bags, we can cut down on the plastic bags that are so often just thrown away after one use.  Then they find their way into landfills, or worse, into the sea where they can damage or hurt sea life.<p>
      <li>Plant trees</li>
      <p>Trees can help reduce global warming by taking in carbon dioxide.  Every year, a young tree can absorb 13 pounds of the gas each year.  Another plus is that trees can also remove sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and samll particles from the air.</p>
      <li>Compost</li>
      <p>Composting is another way to use kitchen and yard waste instead of it just ending up in a landfill somewhere.  Composting also is useful as fertilizer since it enriches soil by adding nutrients to the soil and introducing organisms that can help decompose organic material.</p>
      <li>Use other methods of transportation then cars</li>
      <p>Not using cars can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also improve your gas mileage which saves you money.  Walking, biking, or taking public transportation helps to decrease greenhouse gases, too, and helps you burn more calories.  
    </ul>
