    <p>Fossil fuels damage the earth’s atmosphere. A way to make sure that the atmosphere is healthy and whole. Biking or walking to places that are close to you goes a long way for saving the environment. We understand that you can’t bike or walk everywhere, but anywhere that you can is a big help. Fossil fuels encourage global warming. Global warming affects multiple areas including the coral reefs. The coral reefs are dying because there is too much carbon dioxide in the ocean. Not only does it affect the ocean but the air as well. The air that we breathe in is getting dirtier because of the chemicals being released into the air.</p>
